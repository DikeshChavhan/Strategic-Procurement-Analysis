üß† Procurement Strategy Optimization Using Kraljic Matrix & Machine Learning

üìò Overview

This project leverages Machine Learning and Strategic Procurement Analysis to classify products and materials based on the Kraljic Matrix Framework ‚Äî a powerful model for supply chain strategy optimization.

By analyzing supply risk, profit impact, and other procurement parameters, this model automatically identifies whether an item is Strategic, Leverage, Bottleneck, or Non-Critical, enabling smarter sourcing and inventory decisions.

üéØ Problem Statement

Procurement professionals often face challenges in determining which items deserve strategic attention and which can be managed operationally. Traditional classification methods are manual, time-consuming, and prone to human bias.

This project aims to:

Analyze procurement data using risk and impact-based metrics.

Build an automated machine learning classifier that categorizes items into Kraljic quadrants.

Identify the most influential features driving procurement strategy.

Provide visual insights to support data-driven supply chain decisions.

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

Data Preprocessing

Cleaned missing and inconsistent entries.

Encoded categorical data.

Normalized numeric features for uniform scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution plots for numerical attributes.

Correlation matrix to detect feature relationships.

Visual mapping of Supply Risk vs Profit Impact quadrants.

Model Development

Applied Random Forest Classifier for robust, non-linear decision-making.

Split dataset (75% train / 25% test).

Used LabelEncoder and StandardScaler for preprocessing.

Model persisted using joblib for future inference.

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

Achieved 100% accuracy (due to synthetic consistency).

üß© Kraljic Matrix Categories
Category	Description	Strategy
Strategic Items	High risk, high profit impact	Build partnerships, long-term planning
Leverage Items	Low risk, high profit impact	Maximize negotiation power
Bottleneck Items	High risk, low profit impact	Reduce dependency, find alternatives
Non-Critical Items	Low risk, low profit impact	Optimize efficiency and automation
